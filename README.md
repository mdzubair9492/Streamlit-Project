<h1> Project Name: PaperSage</h1>
<h3> This is basically our IDP project in our university</h3>
<p>So far, we have just done initial frontend part and we will continue to update the design and later we will put the backend part </p>
<b>Features:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Simple User Registration Form</li>
  <li>Notebook Creation</li>
  <li>PDF uploading section</li>
  <li>Simulated Query section to chat with the uploaded pdf ( As we haven't put any backend so there is no RAG model which will answer user query</li>
  <li>And then, there are section to create notes based on multiple pdf given there manually or auto generated from the RAG model ( which is yet to be done )</li>
</ul>
